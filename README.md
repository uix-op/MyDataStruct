# A data structure in the Rust programming language
I wrote a data structure in the Rust programming language, which is just a library for me to learn the Rust programming language. Hope to give me advice. ***Thank you***

__Now I've only generated one project. I'll write later, stacks, heaps, linked lists...__


> ### ***Single-linked lists*** ✅
> > I did some simple things like __inserting__, __creating__, and __testing singly linked lists__
> > I Added **Deletion**, **Insert to Tail**, **More Tests**,**improved README**
> ### heap ❌

> ### stack ❌

> ### Binary tree ❌
